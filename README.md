# mp3encoder
With this program you can encode WAVE or AIFF files to MP3 or recode existing MP3 files.
It can watch folders and automatically encode the files or you can drag and drop specific files for encoding.
Existing ID3-Tags are kept, but a simple ID3-Tag editor is also included.

Mp3encoder comes with a graphical user interface based on Qt5 and PPLib7 and uses mpg123 for decoding and lame for encoding mp3 files.
